This is my first attempt at a 14x5 ortholinear keyboard. It uses Kalih Choc v1 switches but could be easily adjustet to fit almost any switch you want.
The board is built around the WaveShare RP2040-Zero microcontroller and meant to run the open source keyboard firmware KMK.

The board features pads to mount 8 0603 status led´s, however i havent implemented them in the firmware yet.

I intended to mount the PCB to a 3d printed housing via m2 screws. That´s what the six holes are for, however the housing is still a work in progress...
