# 14x5-ortholinear-keyboard
---

This is my first attempt at a 14x5 ortholinear keyboard. Its meant to use Kalih Choc v1 switches but can be easily adjustet to fit allmost any switch you want.
The board is built around the WaveShare RP2040-Zero microcontroller and meant to run the open source keyboard firmware KMK.
